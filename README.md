paunch-cpp
======

Paunch-cpp is a C++ implementation of Paunch, a 2D game engine.

Development Status
------------------
Paunch-cpp is buggy, unstable, and probably not particularly well-written. I
wrote a C++ implementation mostly for experimental purposes. This code would
probably only be useful as a base for your own development.

Features
--------
- Shape drawing and texturing through OpenGL
- Easy-to-use effects system through GLSL shaders
- Simple window management
- Mouse and keyboard input
- Joystick input
- Fast, optomized collision detection
- Flexibly handle complex object movement with multiple forces
- Easy event management through object polling
- Music and sound effect support
- More to come!

To Do
-----
- Support for pre-3.0 OpenGL versions
- Serious bug-fixing
- Smaller improvements from the Go implementation
- Probably more...
